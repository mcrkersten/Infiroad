// Specifies how to generate the V coordinate of UVs in a béziér mesh.
//
// Normalized:
//		The texture is stretched to the full length
// Tiled:
//		The texture is tiling with basic compensation,
//		to prevent the texture from stretching on long curves.
//		It does also snap to the nearest match, to make it seamless with minimal stretching
// TiledDeltaCompensated:
//		Same as Tiled, but it also compensates the inherent non-uniformity of Béziér curves,
//		where the t value does not increase uniformly with distance.
//		This mode prevents that stretching/squishing effect, using a length table!
