This package allows you to easily integrate both the input and ForceFeedback features of DirectX DirectInput from within Unity. This allows you to interface with HID peripherals with ForceFeedback capabilities. This can be used to build vivid simulated experiences.

The package will create a virtual device inside Unity's Input System. This device can then be used like any other device inside the Input System, allowing for easiy rebinding. ForceFeedback capabilites can be acceced via the DIManager class.

## Environment

This plugin only works on Windows 64 bit.

Unity Version: 2021.1.16f1

# Notice

Occasionally calls to EnumerateDevices will take orders of magnitude longer than usual to execute (up to 60 seconds), this is caused by a Windows bug attempting to load an absent hardware device. USB Audio DACs & Corsair keyboards are known the cause this issue, try disconnecting and reconnecting offending USB devices. For more information see [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10967795/directinput8-enumdevices-sometimes-painfully-slow) StackOverflow post about the issue from 2012.
